      <title>Prayers For Mercy</title>
      <link>https://madueke.com/book?book=prayers-for-mercy</link>
      <description>The journey to greatness can be very difficult outside the mercy of God. Do you know about God's mercy? Mercy can be translated as kindness, loving-kindness, good, goodness, pity, and compassion. It is a deep and tender feeling of compassion. God's mercy entails His having a deep and tender feeling of compassion towards us. It is being compassionate and aroused by the sight of weakness or suffering. It means to bend or stoop in kindness or loyalty to an inferior person, to favor or bestow something to him and to be considerate often when it is not expected or deserved. In this all-new message, Prayer Madueke teaches you practical keys on how:. The prayer of Mercy can change the situation. Mercy opens heaven on our prayer; mercy prevails over the judgment of the enemies. Mercy draws the attention of God to us. Mercy makes God forgive our sins and show us kindness. Mercy opens the door for miracles. The steadfast love of the LORD never ceases; his mercies never come to an end; they are n...</description>

      <link>https://madueke.com/freebook?book=quarantined-for-god&lt;/b&gt;s-deliverance</link>
      <description>Plagues do not just happen without reason. When the Egyptians became steeped in evil and iniquity against the people of God, plagues were sent to humble them. Plagues are more horrifying and humiliating than shooting wars. They are a sign that something is terribly wrong. Man has deployed the revealed knowledge of God (science and technology) to wrong uses, destroying and polluting the earth, playing god with genomics and even attempting to slap its creator in the face. There is no depth of decadence that man has not plumbed in a vain attempt to normalize evil and abnormality. Plagues are a time of cleansing, cleansing the earth of pollutants and iniquity. For a child of God, it is a time to put things right in your relationship with God. This is what this book, Quarantined for Deliverance, is about. With over 75 deliverance prayer points, you will be purged to be in order to be saved. When the 10 plagues were unleashed on the Egyptians, the children of God were unaffected. God does no...</description>

      <link>https://madueke.com/devotional?devotion=divine-unmerited-favor</link>
      <description> Your Expectations  For people who want to be great. For people who wish to be blessed like Abraham. For people who want every curse placed upon them to back fire. For people who want God to be their shield and exceeding reward. For people who want God to be their shield and exceeding reward. For those who want God to bless them with uncountable blessings. For those who want to inherit their promise land. For those who want God to fight their battles     By divine unmerited favor, many destinies have been changed for good. People with divine favor are very dangerous to the enemy because they carry with them in their body red marks.   God goes before them and prepares their way and they are normally distinguished and singled out from the crowd. Their names are announced and singled out among the sons of men.   The offerings of favored people are accepted by God and God Himself has respect on their sacrifices. It was the favor of God that kept Joseph alive in the midst of his brethren wh...</description>
