    <h3>The Word of Faith</h3>
    <p>
        Faith is one of God’s phone number and the key that unlocks the door of heaven’s resources. Faith that believes the word of God without doubting can keep a believer in God’s coverage area all the days of his life. Faith means to believe the word of God. You may not need to ask before you receive with this divine phone number. What you just need is only believe and you will receive whatever you want.
        <br>
        <br>
        When in prayer or speak anything, you receive. But in faith, all things are possible with just believing. It then means that you can have anything just by identifying any part of the scriptures that promises you that. Merely identifying any scripture that promises you prosperity can easily cause you to prosper. You can have your healing and deliverance just by faith. What you need is just to believe and it will take place.
        <br>
        <br>
        Faith brings man and God in unity in the realm of the spirit and makes impossibilities possible in a moment. Some of the powers to fight against to have this phone numbers of God are unbelief to God’s word, fear, doubt, and discouragement. One good thing about this particular phone number is that it does not discriminate. Even sinners at times use this number to get to God. Many sinners out of coverage area have used this number and it worked for them.

        This centurion was not a member of the commonwealth of Israel. What made him receive a wonderful miracle was his faith. He told Jesus to speak the word only and his servant shall be healed. That is faith, and that is what God needs from us - only believe. Believing is not only for pastors and workers in the house of God but for anyone who can simply believe. You do not need prayers to believe; neither do you need to pay any money or to obtain a visa to believe. What you need to believe is all written down in the word of God. Just pick up any passage in the scripture and believe in it without fear, unbelief, doubts, or discouragement and you will get whatever you believe. This key is for everyone - sinner, saints or even the occultists; no discrimination; no geographical boundary. Anyone who just believes can have this key. That is why you see many sinners and religious people having great possession and living in health. The secret is just this phone number even without righteousness.
        <br>
        <br>
        Once you believe in Christ, He will impute His righteousness in you. When you have this phone number, even Jesus cannot say no to you. With this phone number, no army or bodyguard of any nation both spiritual and physical can send you away or deny you of your right. Whenever and wherever Jesus sees this kind of phone call with the number appearing on it called, “FAITH”, no matter who is behind it, He responds. Not even worldly kings can resist the ringing of this phone.
